# Engine
This project is a multiplayer based game engine i started 1 year ago for my graduation thesis. Now i am graduated but still updating the engine. Contributions are accepted. Also you can reach to me for anything from my mail address [alinazifkoca@gmail.com](mailto:alinazifkoca@gmail.com)

# Dependencies

[GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) for cross-platform window creation.

[GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) for cross-platform OpenGL binding.

[Bullet 3](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) for physics.

[Sheila](https://github.com/OnPlayerExitVehicle/Sheila) for multiplayer networking. My own library.

# Features

- You can create your own components or use internal ones to determine how your objects will behave.
- You can use physics components to use physics implementations, or create yours.
- You can use networking components to create networked game systems. You can also create networking components with given interfaces.
- Multithreaded networking, no lags or data shadowing between frames.
- Peer-to-peer networking. There is no need for dedicated servers, just one rendezvous server is enough.
- Object loading for OBJ format (beta).

# To Do

- Implement multithreaded rendering.
- Implement and develop various ~~lighting~~, shadowing and rendering techniques.
- Implement object loading for GLB/FBX formats.
- Implement animation engine. (preferably [ozz-animation](https://github.com/guillaumeblanc/ozz-animation))
